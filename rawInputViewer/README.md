Here is a little utility program I made to help with development. 

The main purpose is to display raw escape sequneces generated by special keys / key combinations. 

I decided to include this as a bonus because:
	1. You might want to add support for more special keys to the program.
	2. It's just fun to mash keys and see the ASCII code and sequences. 
	   I suggest trying out arrow keys, function keys, combinations with alt/shift, etc. See if you can figure out the pattern.

** Guide ** 
Once compiled, ./rawInputViwer to run
Ctrl + Q to quit
Ctrl + C to clear screen
